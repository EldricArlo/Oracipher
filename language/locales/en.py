        <h2>Welcome to Oracipher</h2>
        <p>This guide provides essential information about the security, privacy, and core functions of your new password manager.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>Core Security Architecture</h4>
        <p>Your security is our highest priority. Oracipher is built on a foundation of proven, modern cryptographic principles:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Zero-Knowledge:</strong> Your Master Password is your private key. It is <em>never</em> stored on your device or transmitted anywhere. We cannot access, view, or recover it for you. <em>You are in sole control.</em></li>
            <li><strong>Key Derivation (Argon2id):</strong> We use Argon2id to transform your Master Password into a powerful encryption key. This is a memory-hard function that provides strong resistance against brute-force attacks.</li>
            <li><strong>Authenticated Encryption (AES-256):</strong> All data in your vault is encrypted using AES-256 with GCM. This ensures both confidentiality (your data is secret) and integrity (your data cannot be tampered with undetected).</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Your Privacy Commitment</h4>
        <p>We believe that your data belongs to you, and only you.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local-First Storage:</strong> Your entire encrypted vault is stored exclusively on your local device. There is no cloud server, and your data never leaves your computer unless you explicitly export it.</li>
            <li><strong>No Tracking, No Analytics:</strong> This application does not collect any usage data, telemetry, or crash reports. Your activity within the app is your business alone.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h4>Data Management</h4>
        <p>You have full control over your data through the Import and Export functions in the settings.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Secure Backup (.skey):</strong> The <em>.skey</em> format is the recommended way to back up your vault. It's a fully encrypted file that contains all your entries and is protected by your master password.</li>
            <li><strong>Unsecured Export (.csv):</strong> The CSV format is provided for compatibility with other applications. <strong>Warning:</strong> A CSV file is a plain text file. Anyone with access to it can read all your usernames and passwords. Use this format with extreme caution.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h4>About & Contact</h4>
        <p>Oracipher is an open-source project developed with a focus on security and privacy.</p>
