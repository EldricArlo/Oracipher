        <h2>Welcome to SafeKey</h2>
        <p>This guide provides essential information about the security, privacy, and core functions of your new password manager.</p>
        <hr>

        <h4>Core Security Architecture</h4>
        <p>Your security is our highest priority. SafeKey is built on a foundation of proven, modern cryptographic principles:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Zero-Knowledge:</strong> Your Master Password is your private key. It is <em>never</em> stored on your device or transmitted anywhere. We cannot access, view, or recover it for you. <em>You are in sole control.</em></li>
            <li><strong>Key Derivation (Argon2id):</strong> We use Argon2id, a state-of-the-art, memory-hard algorithm, to transform your Master Password into a powerful encryption key. This provides maximum protection against brute-force attacks.</li>
            <li><strong>Authenticated Encryption (AES-256-GCM via Fernet):</strong> All data in your vaultâ€”passwords, notes, URLsâ€”is encrypted using AES-256, the industry standard. This ensures both confidentiality (it cannot be read) and integrity (it cannot be tampered with).</li>
            <li><strong>Secure Clipboard:</strong> When you copy a password or a 2FA code, it will be automatically cleared from your clipboard after 30 seconds to prevent accidental exposure.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Your Privacy Commitment</h4>
        <p>We believe that your data belongs to you, and only you.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local-First Storage:</strong> Your entire encrypted vault is stored exclusively on your local device in the `safekey_data` directory. There are <strong>no cloud servers</strong> involved. Your data never leaves your computer unless you explicitly export it.</li>
            <li><strong>No Tracking, No Analytics:</strong> This application does not collect any usage data, telemetry, or personal information. Your activity within the app is completely private.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Portability:</strong> You have the freedom to move your data. The secure `.skey` format is recommended for backups, while the unencrypted `.csv` format is provided for migration to other services. <em>Please handle `.csv` files with extreme care.</em></li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Key Feature Logic</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>2FA Authenticator (TOTP):</strong> SafeKey can function as your Two-Factor Authentication app. By scanning a QR code or entering a secret key, it will generate time-based one-time passwords (TOTPs), keeping your login credentials and 2FA codes securely in one place.</li>
            <li><strong>Intelligent Import:</strong> The importer is designed to recognize various formats, including encrypted `.skey` backups and plain-text `.csv` files from popular browsers and password managers like Chrome and Bitwarden.</li>
            <li><strong>Concurrent Icon Fetching:</strong> When importing entries with website URLs, SafeKey will attempt to fetch their icons concurrently (in parallel) to speed up the process significantly.</li>
        </ul>
